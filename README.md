# PersonaAI Chatbot Project

## Overview

PersonaAI is an advanced AI chatbot designed to interact with users in a conversational manner. It leverages state-of-the-art language models and embeddings to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The chatbot can handle a variety of topics, maintain context over conversations, and learn from interactions to improve its performance over time.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engages users in natural language conversations.
- **Dynamic Intent Detection**: Identifies user intents and responds appropriately.
- **Personal Knowledge Base**: Utilizes a personalized knowledge base to provide tailored responses.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains context across multiple interactions.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY of PERSONA-AI:
PersonaAI is an advanced conversational AI chatbot designed to interact with users in a natural and intelligent manner. Here's a detailed breakdown of its core functionalities and the technologies it employs:
1. Conversational AI
Natural Language Processing (NLP): PersonaAI uses NLP techniques to understand and generate human-like responses. It processes user inputs to determine the intent and context of the conversation.
Language Models: The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art language models, such as those from Hugging Face, to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.
2. Intent Detection
Dynamic Intent Classification: PersonaAI can classify user queries into different intents, such as general inquiries, identity-related questions, or company-specific queries. This allows the chatbot to tailor its responses based on the detected intent.
Embedding-Based Classification: The chatbot uses embeddings from models like sentence-transformers to represent text in a high-dimensional space, enabling it to perform similarity-based intent classification.
3. Personal Knowledge Base
Custom Knowledge Integration: PersonaAI integrates a personal knowledge base that allows it to provide personalized responses. This knowledge base can include user-specific information, company details, or any other relevant data.
Document Processing: The chatbot processes documents and extracts relevant information to enhance its knowledge base, using tools like FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
4. Contextual Understanding
Conversation Memory: PersonaAI maintains a memory of the conversation history, allowing it to provide contextually aware responses. This is achieved through mechanisms like ConversationBufferMemory.
Contextual Retrieval: The chatbot uses advanced retrieval techniques, such as TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever and MultiQueryRetriever, to fetch relevant information based on the current context of the conversation.
5. Learning and Adaptation
Dynamic Learning: PersonaAI can learn from interactions by updating its intent examples and centroids dynamically. This allows the chatbot to improve its understanding of user intents over time.
Error Handling and Feedback: The chatbot is designed to handle errors gracefully and can incorporate user feedback to refine its responses and improve its performance.
Technologies Used
LangChain: A framework that provides tools for building language model applications, including chains for retrieval, question answering, and conversational AI.
Hugging Face Transformers: Used for leveraging pre-trained language models to generate responses and perform text embeddings.
FAISS: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
Python: The primary programming language used to implement the chatbot's logic and integrate various components.
Summary
PersonaAI is a sophisticated AI chatbot that combines advanced NLP techniques, dynamic intent detection, and a personalized knowledge base to deliver intelligent and contextually relevant interactions. It continuously learns from user interactions to enhance its performance and provide a more personalized experience.


MORE TO COME : 

Will added more functionalities here it is just a start of my project and not a big huge level things just a basic but core starting will be added some more features. Thank you.
